#### Assignment 

> You're asked to create a pizza configurator for NewAgePizza.com, a new and hip venture to get your pizza. It should be a single page > > > that contains all the following elements.

> First you pick your base. You have four options:

> * 25cm NY Style â‚¬ 8,99
> * 30cm NY Style â‚¬ 11,49
> * 35cm NY Style â‚¬ 13,49
> * 20cm NY Style â‚¬ 6,45

> After that you pick your sauce options:

> * White sauce
> * Red sauce
> * Double red sauce â‚¬ 1,00
> * Mix it up â‚¬ 1,50

> After that you pick one or more toppings:

> * Pineapple
> * Corn
> * Olives (green)
> * Red unioun
> * Spinach
> * Cherry tomatoes
> * Chicken
> Rules: max. 3 toppings, toppings cost â‚¬ 0,50 apiece

> Last but not least, you can choose turbo-drone-delivery which is an additional 10% on top of the total pizza price.

> Make sure you can change previous steps even if you already changed stuff before. So I could pick a base, a sauce and a topping and 
> switch the base after that.

> Additional instructions:

> * If any base is picked there should always be a price shown for the total pizza.
> * The redux store should contain the state of the pizza
> * You don't need any backend connection
> * Make sure you split your app into separate components
> * We expect you to use controlled form components as they are the best practise
> * Bonus points if you use Material-UI (v1)
